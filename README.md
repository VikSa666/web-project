# web-project

Website project with the objective of learning html, javascript and css and try new things. The website is based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJzuN5UGqmo&t=875s) tutorial, so the styles are very similar because I'm new at CSS. All this is to try things out.

To see the web project, you just have to clone this repo and open [this link](http://127.0.0.1:5501/)
